# Homepage: Getting Started

In this course, we'll use GitHub Classroom to distribute project starter files. To begin this project:

1. [Click here](https://classroom.github.com/a/_ZZS7O_t) to go to the GitHub Classroom page for starting the assignment.
2. Click the green "Accept this assignment" button. This will create a GitHub repository for your project. Recall that a git repository is just a location where your code will be stored and which can be used to keep track of changes you make to your code over time.
3. Click on the link that follows "Your assignment has been created here", which will direct you to the GitHub repository page for your project. It may take a few seconds for GitHub to finish creating your repository.
4. Now, you should be looking at a GitHub repository titled uva-webapps/homepage-username, where username is your GitHub username. This will be the repository to which you will push all of your code while working on your project. You will commit directly to this repository.
5. Before you go on, **submit the link** to your repository through the form at the very bottom of this page. If your do not see a form, make sure that you're logged in!
6. Because we added a git branch called `"gh-pages"`, GitHub Pages should already be enabled for the repository. Navigate to the main page of the repository and click "environment" > "Deployments" and then on the "View deployment" button. You should see the URL at which your GitHub pages website will (soon) live! But first, we'll need to add some HTML to your repository.
