# macOS: Installing

To develop web apps you need some tools on you laptop. This guide helps you with installing al these tools.

We assume you're running the latest Mac OS, Catalina. Please ask if you're running an older version and can't upgrade.


## Step 1: Command Line Tools

Open the Terminal app (press `⌘Space`, type terminal and press enter).

Run

    xcode-select --install

and click "Install".


## Step 2: Brew

Some useful development tools can be installed on Mac using "Homebrew".

1. Open the terminal app (press `⌘-Space`, type **terminal** and press enter).

2. Go to the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) website, copy-paste the "Install Homebrew" command into your Terminal window and press enter.

3. Homebrew should now install.


## Step 3: Sass

Open the Terminal app and run

    brew install sass/sass/sass

to install [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for Project 0.


## Step 4: A code editor

Good free code editors are: Free code editors are [Textmate](https://macromates.com/download), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). We would recommend Textmate, but you are free to choose another editor if you like.
